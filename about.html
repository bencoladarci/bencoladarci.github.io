                <p>Hi, I'm Ben Coladarci—a tech enthusiast with a solid foundation in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. I earned my BA in Computer Science, graduating Cum Laude from the University of Rhode Island, where hands-on projects in programming, data science, and network security sparked my passion for IT support and project management.</p>
                <p>Today, I work at i2Systems as an IT Operations Support Associate and ERP Implementation Project Manager. I handle IT operations for the entire company, often as a “department of one.” I’ve led projects like implementing an ERP system and deploying network infrastructure, and I've set up systems for ticketing and server monitoring to keep everything running smoothly. I also led a cybersecurity initiative to improve compliance, securing a grant to enhance our tools.</p>
                <p>I love making tech accessible to everyone. I’m always excited to learn and grow in this field, and I look forward to tackling new challenges and contributing to projects that make a difference.</p>
